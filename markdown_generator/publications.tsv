2020-12-31	KART: Privacy Leakage Framework of Language Models Pre-trained with Clinical Records	arXiv preprint	For the safe sharing pre-trained language models, no guidelines exist at present owing to the difficulty in estimating the upper bound of the risk of privacy leakage. One problem is that previous studies have assessed the risk for different real-world privacy leakage scenarios and attack methods, which reduces the portability of the findings. To tackle this problem, we represent complex real-world privacy leakage scenarios under a universal parameterization, \textit{Knowledge, Anonymization, Resource, and Target} (KART). KART parameterization has two merits: (i) it clarifies the definition of privacy leakage in each experiment and (ii) it improves the comparability of the findings of risk assessments. We show that previous studies can be simply reviewed by parameterizing the scenarios with KART. We also demonstrate privacy risk assessments in different scenarios under the same attack method, which suggests that KART helps approximate the upper bound of risk under a specific attack or scenario. We believe that KART helps integrate past and future findings on privacy risk and will contribute to a standard for sharing language models.	<b>Yuta Nakamura</b>, Shouhei Hanaoka, Yukihiro Nomura, Naoto Hayashi, Osamu Abe, Shuntaro Yada, Shoko Wakamiya, Eiji Aramaki.

Overlaying colored lesion candidates on volume-rendered images can help them detect more aneurysms.

Natural language processing (NLP) has been shown to help identify free-text radiology reports including actionable findings. However, the application of recent deep learning techniques to radiology reports, which can improve the detection performance, has not been thoroughly examined. Moreover, free-text that clinicians input in the ordering form (order information) has seldom been used to identify actionable reports. This study aims to evaluate the benefits of two new approaches: (1) bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), a recent deep learning architecture in NLP, and (2) using order information in addition to radiology reports.	<b>Yuta Nakamura</b>, Shouhei Hanaoka, Yukihiro Nomura, Takahiro Nakao, Soichiro Miki, Takeyuki Watadani, Takeharu Yoshikawa, Naoto Hayashi, Osamu Abe.

2022-06-02	Natural Language Processing: from Bedside to Everywhere	Yearbook of Medical Informatics	Owing to the rapid progress of natural language processing (NLP), the role of NLP in the medical field has radically gained considerable attention from both NLP and medical informatics. Although numerous medical NLP papers are published annually, there is still a gap between basic NLP research and practical product development. This gap raises questions, such as what has medical NLP achieved in each medical field, and what is the burden for the practical use of NLP? This paper aims to clarify the above questions.

2022-06-06	"Clinical Comparable Corpus Describing the Same Subjects with Different Expressions "	Studies in Health Technology and Informatics	Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems need to learn to recognize synonyms or paraphrases describing the same anatomy, disease, treatment, etc. to better understand real-world clinical documents. Existing linguistic resources focus on variants at the word or sentence level. To handle linguistic variations on a broader scale, we proposed the Medical Text Radiology Report section Japanese version (MedTxt-RR-JA), the first clinical comparable corpus. MedTxt-RR-JA was built by recruiting nine radiologists to diagnose the same 15 lung cancer cases in Radiopaedia, an open-access radiological repository. The 135 radiology reports in MedTxt-RR-JA were shown to contain word-, sentence- and document-level variations maintaining similarity of contents. MedTxt-RR-JA is also the first publicly available Japanese radiology report corpus that would help to overcome poor data availability for Japanese medical AI systems. Moreover, our methodology can be applied widely to building clinical corpora without privacy concerns.

2023-02-21	Playing the Werewolf game with artificial intelligence for language understanding	arXiv preprint	The Werewolf game is a social deduction game based on free natural language communication, in which players try to deceive others in order to survive. An important feature of this game is that a large portion of the conversations are false information, and the behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) in such a situation has not been widely investigated. The purpose of this study is to develop an AI agent that can play Werewolf through natural language conversations. First, we collected game logs from 15 human players. Next, we fine-tuned a Transformer-based pretrained language model to construct a value network that can predict a posterior probability of winning a game at any given phase of the game and given a candidate for the next action. We then developed an AI agent that can interact with humans and choose the best voting target on the basis of its probability from the value network. Lastly, we evaluated the performance of the agent by having it actually play the game with human players. We found that our AI agent, Deep Wolf, could play Werewolf as competitively as average human players in a villager or a betrayer role, whereas Deep Wolf was inferior to human players in a werewolf or a seer role. These results suggest that current language models have the capability to suspect what others are saying, tell a lie, or detect lies in conversations.

We provide a visual reasoning dataset focusing on numerical understanding in the medical domain. The experiments using our dataset show that current vision-and-language models fail to perform numerical inference in the medical domain. However, the data augmentation with only a small amount of our dataset improves the model performance, while maintaining the performance in the general domain.

The enlarged axillary lymph nodes decreased both in size and in signal intensity on T2-weighted images of follow-up MRI. The ADC remained unchanged.
