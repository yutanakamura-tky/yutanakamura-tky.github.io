title: "Clinical Comparable Corpus Describing the Same Subjects with Different Expressions "
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-06-06-clinical-comparable-corpus
excerpt: 'Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems need to learn to recognize synonyms or paraphrases describing the same anatomy, disease, treatment, etc. to better understand real-world clinical documents. Existing linguistic resources focus on variants at the word or sentence level. To handle linguistic variations on a broader scale, we proposed the Medical Text Radiology Report section Japanese version (MedTxt-RR-JA), the first clinical comparable corpus. MedTxt-RR-JA was built by recruiting nine radiologists to diagnose the same 15 lung cancer cases in Radiopaedia, an open-access radiological repository. The 135 radiology reports in MedTxt-RR-JA were shown to contain word-, sentence- and document-level variations maintaining similarity of contents. MedTxt-RR-JA is also the first publicly available Japanese radiology report corpus that would help to overcome poor data availability for Japanese medical AI systems. Moreover, our methodology can be applied widely to building clinical corpora without privacy concerns.'

Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems need to learn to recognize synonyms or paraphrases describing the same anatomy, disease, treatment, etc. to better understand real-world clinical documents. Existing linguistic resources focus on variants at the word or sentence level. To handle linguistic variations on a broader scale, we proposed the Medical Text Radiology Report section Japanese version (MedTxt-RR-JA), the first clinical comparable corpus. MedTxt-RR-JA was built by recruiting nine radiologists to diagnose the same 15 lung cancer cases in Radiopaedia, an open-access radiological repository. The 135 radiology reports in MedTxt-RR-JA were shown to contain word-, sentence- and document-level variations maintaining similarity of contents. MedTxt-RR-JA is also the first publicly available Japanese radiology report corpus that would help to overcome poor data availability for Japanese medical AI systems. Moreover, our methodology can be applied widely to building clinical corpora without privacy concerns.
