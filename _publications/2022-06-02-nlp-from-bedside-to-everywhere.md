excerpt: 'Owing to the rapid progress of natural language processing (NLP), the role of NLP in the medical field has radically gained considerable attention from both NLP and medical informatics. Although numerous medical NLP papers are published annually, there is still a gap between basic NLP research and practical product development. This gap raises questions, such as what has medical NLP achieved in each medical field, and what is the burden for the practical use of NLP? This paper aims to clarify the above questions.'

Owing to the rapid progress of natural language processing (NLP), the role of NLP in the medical field has radically gained considerable attention from both NLP and medical informatics. Although numerous medical NLP papers are published annually, there is still a gap between basic NLP research and practical product development. This gap raises questions, such as what has medical NLP achieved in each medical field, and what is the burden for the practical use of NLP? This paper aims to clarify the above questions.
