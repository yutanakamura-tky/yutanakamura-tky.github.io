title: "Axillary Lymphadenopathy after COVID-19 Vaccination: Follow-up for Enlarged Lymph Nodes on MR Imaging"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-02-07-axillary-lymphadenopathy-covid19-vaccination
excerpt: 'The purpose of this study was to investigate the longitudinal MRI characteristic of COVID-19-vaccination-related axillary lymphadenopathy by evaluating the size, T2-weighted signal intensity, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. The enlarged axillary lymph nodes decreased both in size and in signal intensity on T2-weighted images of follow-up MRI. The ADC remained unchanged.'

The purpose of this study was to investigate the longitudinal MRI characteristic of COVID-19-vaccination-related axillary lymphadenopathy by evaluating the size, T2-weighted signal intensity, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. The enlarged axillary lymph nodes decreased both in size and in signal intensity on T2-weighted images of follow-up MRI. The ADC remained unchanged.
