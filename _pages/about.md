## About me
I am a biomedical natural language processing (NLP) researcher and a board-certified diagnostic radiologist at the University of Tokyo Hospital.

My ambition is to introduce NLP to enhance clinical workflows and improve the quality of care. A particular area of interest is addressing the shortage of open-access Japanese language resources in the biomedical field.

To this end, I have created approximately 400 Japanese radiology reports that are devoid of personal information and made them publicly available. Using these resources, I have organized two shared tasks during <a href="https://sociocom.naist.jp/real-mednlp/" target="_blank">NTCIR-16</a> and <a href="https://sociocom.naist.jp/mednlp-sc/" target="_blank">NTCIR-17</a>, with the aim of fostering innovation and enhancing collaboration between the NLP and medical communities.
